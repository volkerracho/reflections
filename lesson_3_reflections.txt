When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Share with other people and access from different local machines.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So that I only pull data when there is a logical benefit.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another? 
Forks copy a repository within github, clone copies a repository from github to alocal machine, or on a local machine. Branches allow working on different areas of one repository or by different users.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can work on you projects while seeing all changes that were done in the meantime and being completely up to date in the project.
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
No idea about alternatives. Sharing code and updating the same project definately would become harder.
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Changing master is less tedious as we just need to save down a commit for the changes. Creating a new branch and a pull request on the other hand lets us suggest changes to other participants and wait for their feedback before changing master branch.
