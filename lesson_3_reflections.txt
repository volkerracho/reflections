When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Share with other people and access from different local machines.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
So that I only pull data when there is a logical benefit.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another? 
Forks copy a repository within github, clone copies a repository from github to alocal machine, or on a local machine. Branches allow working on different areas of one repository or by different users.
